# 1337x-qBittorrent-search-plugin
1337x.to search plugin for qBittorrent torrent client

This plugin extracts torrent from [1337x](https://1337x.to/) using python's built-in HTMLParser. It is compatible with both Python2 and Python3.
It is follows qBittorrent's official [documentation to build search engine](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-write-a-search-plugin).

Forked from [here](https://github.com/v1k45/1337x-qBittorrent-search-plugin) and updated by me to work for [1337x](https://1337x.to/) as of 29 July, 2024.
